# Software Engineer / MERN Stack Developer

I'm self taught developer who works as an Intern Software Engineer.I love to write code and learn new technologies. I have been working on my blog to teach coding for others since 2019.

I started my programming career when I was 16 years old .My first language was Python and then after I learnt C# , Java and Javascript. In edge of 2017 I moved into web development & now work on web development in full time.

```javascript
while(true){
    code()  // Literally for 10-12 hours
    learn() // 4-5 hours
    teach() // 2 hours
    sleep() 
}
```

* Currently I'm working at Beta Launch 🔨 as an Intern Software Engineer
* I'm interested on Devops in these days
